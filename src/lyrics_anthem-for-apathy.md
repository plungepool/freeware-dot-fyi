# anthem for apathy lyrics

close enough to lay
cemented in the streets
you live amongst the moguls you make enough to eat

and we can play
their game forever tired!

they will sow division
they’ll grind you like a cog
they’ll throw your shit onto the curb and take away your job

and for a time we might stay
silent in retreat
but severance is sudden death and now we'll make you weep

anthem for apathy
disown
what you don’t own
fear and anxiety
is for the assholes in the c-suite

plea for sobriety
you know
all you can know
your health and propriety
you can't give it to em would ya do ya

they'll always squeeze more blood from stone
they'll trick you into being scared
you can't make me care
no you can't make me care

they'll take advantage of your good sincerity 
every last drop of your sanity
you can't make me care
no you can't make me care!! (repeat after me)

just because they pay a price, does not mean they get your life
("")
layoffs should mean nothing to you, it's monkey-see and monkey-doo-hoo
("")
when they choose to pay increase, the greatest good gets paid the least
("")
every time you're being jostled, they only can because you're docile
("")

cuz I’ve been dealt with psychic damage
self-inflicted moral panic
I just can’t stand the manic planage
no more sheep, we’re wolves you manage
(2x)

(cuz no one wants to work, inflation served its use
so tighten up your belt while we all tie up your noose)

cuz no one wants to work
inflation served its use
so tighten up your belt
while we all tie up your---!!

anthem for apathy
disown
what you don’t own
fear and anxiety
is for the assholes in the c suite

plea for sobriety
you know
all you can know
your health and propriety
you can't give it to em would ya do ya
