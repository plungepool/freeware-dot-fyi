      <h1>anthem for apathy lyrics</h1>
<p>close enough to lay
cemented in the streets
you live amongst the moguls you make enough to eat</p>
<p>and we can play
their game forever tired!</p>
<p>they will sow division
they’ll grind you like a cog
they’ll throw your shit onto the curb and take away your job</p>
<p>and for a time we might stay
silent in retreat
but severance is sudden death and now we'll make you weep</p>
<p>anthem for apathy
disown
what you don’t own
fear and anxiety
is for the assholes in the c-suite</p>
<p>plea for sobriety
you know
all you can know
your health and propriety
you can't give it to em would ya do ya</p>
<p>they'll always squeeze more blood from stone
they'll trick you into being scared
you can't make me care
no you can't make me care</p>
<p>they'll take advantage of your good sincerity 
every last drop of your sanity
you can't make me care
no you can't make me care!! (repeat after me)</p>
<p>just because they pay a price, does not mean they get your life
("")
layoffs should mean nothing to you, it's monkey-see and monkey-doo-hoo
("")
when they choose to pay increase, the greatest good gets paid the least
("")
every time you're being jostled, they only can because you're docile
("")</p>
<p>cuz I’ve been dealt with psychic damage
self-inflicted moral panic
I just can’t stand the manic planage
no more sheep, we’re wolves you manage
(2x)</p>
<p>(cuz no one wants to work, inflation served its use
so tighten up your belt while we all tie up your noose)</p>
<p>cuz no one wants to work
inflation served its use
so tighten up your belt
while we all tie up your---!!</p>
<p>anthem for apathy
disown
what you don’t own
fear and anxiety
is for the assholes in the c suite</p>
<p>plea for sobriety
you know
all you can know
your health and propriety
you can't give it to em would ya do ya</p>
